# MU 3100 Semester Project
by Cedar Hudgens for Cal Poly Pomona

## Background
This project was written for [Velato](https://velato.net/), an esoteric programming language
where change in pitch determines the command output. 
  
This program can be run by downloading the Velato reference compiler [here]() and using the .mid file.
There is also an online compiler available [here](https://velato-online.azurewebsites.net/upload), but the site has been down. 
Wistling the tune [here](https://velato.net/HandsFree) should also yeild results.
